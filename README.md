This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v20.13.1` and `10.5.2` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

### Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

### Run

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
